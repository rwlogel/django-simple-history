Advanced Usage
==============

Database Migrations
-------------------

By default, Historical models live in the same app as the model they
track. Historical models are tracked by migrations in the same way as
any other model. Whenever the original model changes, the historical
model will change also.

Therefore tracking historical models with migrations should work
automatically.


Locating past model instance
----------------------------

Two extra methods are provided for locating previous models instances on
historical record model managers.

as_of
~~~~~

This method will return an instance of the model as it would have existed at
the provided date and time.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> poll.history.as_of(datetime(2010, 10, 25, 18, 4, 0))
    <Poll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:03:29.855689>
    >>> poll.history.as_of(datetime(2010, 10, 25, 18, 5, 0))
    <Poll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:04:13.814128>

most_recent
~~~~~~~~~~~

This method will return the most recent copy of the model available in the
model history.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> poll.history.most_recent()
    <Poll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:04:13.814128>


.. _register:

History for a Third-Party Model
-------------------------------

To track history for a model you didn't create, use the
``simple_history.register`` utility.  You can use this to track models from
third-party apps you don't have control over.  Here's an example of using
``simple_history.register`` to history-track the ``User`` model from the
``django.contrib.auth`` app:

.. code-block:: python

    from simple_history import register
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

    register(User)


Allow tracking to be inherited
---------------------------------

By default history tracking is only added for the model that is passed
to ``register()`` or has the ``HistoricalRecords`` descriptor. By
passing ``inherit=True`` to either way of registering you can change
that behavior so that any child model inheriting from it will have
historical tracking as well. Be careful though, in cases where a model
can be tracked more than once, ``MultipleRegistrationsError`` will be
raised.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from django.db import models
    from simple_history import register
    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

    # register() example
    register(User, inherit=True)

    # HistoricalRecords example
    class Poll(models.Model):
        history = HistoricalRecords(inherit=True)

Both ``User`` and ``Poll`` in the example above will cause any model
inheriting from them to have historical tracking as well.


.. recording_user:

Recording Which User Changed a Model
------------------------------------

To denote which user changed a model, assign a ``_history_user`` attribute on
your model.

For example if you have a ``changed_by`` field on your model that records which
user last changed the model, you could create a ``_history_user`` property
referencing the ``changed_by`` field:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
        changed_by = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
        history = HistoricalRecords()

        @property
        def _history_user(self):
            return self.changed_by

        @_history_user.setter
        def _history_user(self, value):
            self.changed_by = value

Admin integration requires that you use a ``_history_user.setter`` attribute with your custom ``_history_user`` property (see :ref:`admin_integration`).

Change User Model
------------------------------------

If you need to use a different user model then ``settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL``,
pass in the required model to ``user_model``.  Doing this requires ``_history_user`` is provided.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

    class PollUser(models.Model):
        user_id = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')


    # Only PollUsers should be modifying a Poll
    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
        changed_by = models.ForeignKey(PollUser)
        history = HistoricalRecords(user_model=PollUser)

        @property
        def _history_user(self):
            return self.changed_by

        @_history_user.setter
        def _history_user(self, value):
            self.changed_by = value

Custom ``history_id``
---------------------

By default, the historical table of a model will use an ``AutoField`` for the table's
``history_id`` (the history table's primary key). However, you can specify a different
type of field for ``history_id`` buy passing a different field to ``history_id_field``
parameter.

A common use case for this would be to use a ``UUIDField``.  If you want to use a ``UUIDField``
as the default for all classes set ``SIMPLE_HISTORY_HISTORY_ID_USE_UUID=True`` in the settings.
This setting can still be overridden using the ``history_id_field`` parameter on a per model basis.

You can use the ``history_id_field`` parameter with both ``HistoricalRecords()`` or
``register()`` to change this behavior.

Note: regardless of what field type you specify as your history_id field, that field will
automatically set ``primary_key=True`` and ``editable=False``.

.. code-block:: python

    import uuid
    from django.db import models
    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
        history = HistoricalRecords(
            history_id_field=models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4)
        )


Custom ``history_date``
-----------------------

You're able to set a custom ``history_date`` attribute for the historical
record, by defining the property ``_history_date`` in your model. That's
helpful if you want to add versions to your model, which happened before the
current model version, e.g. when batch importing historical data. The content
of the property ``_history_date`` has to be a datetime-object, but setting the
value of the property to a ``DateTimeField``, which is already defined in the
model, will work too.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
        changed_by = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
        history = HistoricalRecords()
        __history_date = None

        @property
        def _history_date(self):
            return self.__history_date

        @_history_date.setter
        def _history_date(self, value):
            self.__history_date = value

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    from models import Poll

    my_poll = Poll(question="what's up?")
    my_poll._history_date = datetime.now()
    my_poll.save()


Change Base Class of HistoricalRecord Models
--------------------------------------------

To change the auto-generated HistoricalRecord models base class from
``models.Model``, pass in the abstract class in a list to ``bases``.

.. code-block:: python

    class RoutableModel(models.Model):
        class Meta:
            abstract = True


    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
        changed_by = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
        history = HistoricalRecords(bases=[RoutableModel])

Custom history table name
-------------------------

By default, the table name for historical models follow the Django convention
and just add ``historical`` before model name. For instance, if your application
name is ``polls`` and your model name ``Question``, then the table name will be
``polls_historicalquestion``.

You can use the ``table_name`` parameter with both ``HistoricalRecords()`` or
``register()`` to change this behavior.

.. code-block:: python

    class Question(models.Model):
        question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
        history = HistoricalRecords(table_name='polls_question_history')

.. code-block:: python

    class Question(models.Model):
        question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

    register(Question, table_name='polls_question_history')

Choosing fields to not be stored
--------------------------------

It is possible to use the parameter ``excluded_fields`` to choose which fields
will be stored on every create/update/delete.

For example, if you have the model:

.. code-block:: python

    class PollWithExcludeFields(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

And you don't want to store the changes for the field ``pub_date``, it is necessary to update the model to:

.. code-block:: python

    class PollWithExcludeFields(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

        history = HistoricalRecords(excluded_fields=['pub_date'])

By default, django-simple-history stores the changes for all fields in the model.

Change Reason
-------------

Change reason is a message to explain why the change was made in the instance. It is stored in the
field ``history_change_reason`` and its default value is ``None``.

By default, the django-simple-history gets the change reason in the field ``changeReason`` of the instance. Also, is possible to pass
the ``changeReason`` explicitly. For this, after a save or delete in an instance, is necessary call the
function ``utils.update_change_reason``. The first argument of this function is the instance and the seccond
is the message that represents the change reason.

For instance, for the model:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        history = HistoricalRecords()

You can create a instance with a implicity change reason.

.. code-block:: python

    poll = Poll(question='Question 1')
    poll.changeReason = 'Add a question'
    poll.save()

Or you can pass the change reason explicitly:

.. code-block:: python

    from simple_history.utils import update_change_reason

    poll = Poll(question='Question 1')
    poll.save()
    update_change_reason(poll, 'Add a question')

Save without a historical record
--------------------------------

If you want to save a model without a historical record, you can use the following:

.. code-block:: python

    class Poll(models.Model):
        question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        history = HistoricalRecords()

        def save_without_historical_record(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.skip_history_when_saving = True
            try:
                ret = self.save(*args, **kwargs)
            finally:
                del self.skip_history_when_saving
            return ret


    poll = Poll(question='something')
    poll.save_without_historical_record()
